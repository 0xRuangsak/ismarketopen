# ismarketopen

A simple, minimal website that shows which major stock markets are currently open or closed.

## Concept

**Problem:** Existing market clock websites are cluttered with ads, news, and unnecessary features.

**Solution:** A clean, single-purpose tool that answers one question: "Is the market open?"
