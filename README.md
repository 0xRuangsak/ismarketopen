# ismarketopen

A simple, minimal website that shows which major stock markets are currently open or closed.

---

## Concept

**Problem:** Existing market clock websites are cluttered with ads, news, and unnecessary features.

**Solution:** A clean, single-purpose tool that answers one question: "Is the market open?"

---

## Layout

**Section 1: Time Display**
- UTC time
- Your local time

**Section 2: Market Table**
| Market | Status | Countdown |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| NYSE   | Open/Closed | Time until open/close |
| ...    | ...    | ...       |

## Markets to Track

- NYSE / NASDAQ (New York)
- LSE (London)
- TSE (Tokyo)

- SSE (Shanghai)
- FSE (Frankfurt)
- ASX (Sydney)
